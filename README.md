# C-CPP Repository

This repository contains implementations in both C and C++ for various data structures and projects. The main highlights of this repository include:

- **HashSet Implementation (C)**: A custom implementation of a HashSet, which provides efficient methods for storing and retrieving unique elements.
- **Vector Implementation (C)**: A dynamic array implementation that supports common operations such as resizing, insertion, and access.
- **IMDb Finder (C++)**: A C++ project that uses pointer arithmetic and addresses to search and retrieve data from an array, showcasing low-level memory manipulation.

## Projects

### HashSet (C)
A simple yet efficient implementation of a HashSet in C. It includes the basic operations of inserting, searching, and deleting elements, and utilizes hash functions for efficient lookup.

### Vector (C)
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Vector (dynamic array) in C. It provides functionality like resizing the array, inserting and removing elements, and random access.

### IMDb Finder (C++)
An implementation of a data searcher for movie data, focusing on pointer arithmetic to find information within an array of pointers. The project demonstrates how low-level memory access can be used to retrieve movie details based on user input.
